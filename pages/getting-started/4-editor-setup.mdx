# Editor Setup

Lune prioritizes developer experience, and as such type definitions and documentation are provided
for several editors and tools without any additional downloads. This guide will help you get set up
with your editor environment.

## Luau Language Server

Lune provides type definitions and documentation using the open source Luau Language Server, also
known as [`luau-lsp`](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp).

These steps assume you have access to a terminal, that you have already installed Lune, and that it
is available to run in the current directory.

<Steps>

### Step 1

Run the following command in your terminal to generate Luau type definitions for your installed
version of Lune:

```sh
lune --setup
```

### Step 2

Verify that type definition files have been generated, these should be located in your home
directory and you can list them using `ls`:

```sh
ls ~/.lune/.typedefs/
```

Your currently installed version of Lune should appear, along with any previously installed versions
you have type definitions for, when running this command.

### Step 3

Modify your editor settings. If you are using Visual Studio Code you can do this either by using the
settings menu or by manually pasting these settings in your `settings.json` file:

```json
"luau-lsp.require.mode": "relativeToFile",
"luau-lsp.require.directoryAliases": {
	"@lune/": "~/.lune/.typedefs/x.y.z/"
}
```

These settings will:

-   Set the require mode to work with Lune
-   Add type definitions for Lune built-in libraries

_**NOTE:** If you already had a `.vscode/settings.json` file in your current directory the type
definition files may have been added automatically!_

</Steps>
